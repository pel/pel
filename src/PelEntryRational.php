/**
 * Class for holding unsigned rational numbers.
 *
 * This class can hold rational numbers, consisting of a numerator and
 * denominator both of which are of type unsigned long. Each rational
 * is represented by an array with just two entries: the numerator and
 * the denominator, in that order.
 *
 * The class can hold either just a single rational or an array of
 * rationals. The class will be used to manipulate any of the Exif
 * tags which can have format {@link PelFormat::RATIONAL} like in this
 * example:
 *
 * <code>
 * $resolution = $ifd->getEntry(PelTag::X_RESOLUTION);
 * $resolution->setValue([1, 300]);
 * </code>
 *
 * Here the x-resolution is adjusted to 1/300, which will be 300 DPI,
 * unless the {@link PelTag::RESOLUTION_UNIT resolution unit} is set
 * to something different than 2 which means inches.
