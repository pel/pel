/**
 * Class for a user comment.
 *
 * This class is used to hold user comments, which can come in several
 * different character encodings. The Exif standard specifies a
 * certain format of the {@link PelTag::USER_COMMENT user comment
 * tag}, and this class will make sure that the format is kept.
 *
 * The most basic use of this class simply stores an ASCII encoded
 * string for later retrieval using {@link getValue}:
 *
 * <code>
 * $entry = new PelEntryUserComment('An ASCII string');
 * echo $entry->getValue();
 * </code>
 *
 * The string can be encoded with a different encoding, and if so, the
 * encoding must be given using the second argument. The Exif
 * standard specifies three known encodings: 'ASCII', 'JIS', and
 * 'Unicode'. If the user comment is encoded using a character
 * encoding different from the tree known encodings, then the empty
 * string should be passed as encoding, thereby specifying that the
 * encoding is undefined.
