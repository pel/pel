/**
 * Class for holding copyright information.
 *
 * The Exif standard specifies a certain format for copyright
 * information where the one {@link PelTag::COPYRIGHT copyright
 * tag} holds both the photographer and editor copyrights, separated
 * by a NULL character.
 *
 * This class is used to manipulate that tag so that the format is
 * kept to the standard. A common use would be to add a new copyright
 * tag to an image, since most cameras do not add this tag themselves.
 * This would be done like this:
 *
 * <code>
 * $entry = new PelEntryCopyright('Copyright, Martin Geisler, 2004');
 * $ifd0->addEntry($entry);
 * </code>
 *
 * Here we only set the photographer copyright, use the optional
 * second argument to specify the editor copyright. If there is only
 * an editor copyright, then let the first argument be the empty
 * string.
