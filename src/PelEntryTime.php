/**
 * Class for holding a date and time.
 *
 * This class can hold a timestamp, and it will be used as
 * in this example where the time is advanced by one week:
 * <code>
 * $entry = $ifd->getEntry(PelTag::DATE_TIME_ORIGINAL);
 * $time = $entry->getValue();
 * print('The image was taken on the ' . date('jS', $time));
 * $entry->setValue($time + 7 * 24 * 3600);
 * </code>
 *
 * The example used a standard UNIX timestamp, which is the default
 * for this class.
 *
 * But the Exif format defines dates outside the range of a UNIX
 * timestamp (about 1970 to 2038) and so you can also get access to
 * the timestamp in two other formats: a simple string or a Julian Day
 * Count. Please see the Calendar extension in the PHP Manual for more
 * information about the Julian Day Count.
