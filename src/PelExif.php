 * Class representing Exif data.

 * Exif data resides as {@link PelJpegContent data} and consists of a
 * header followed by a number of {@link PelJpegIfd IFDs}.
 *
 * The interesting method in this class is {@link getTiff()} which
 * will return the {@link PelTiff} object which really holds the data
 * which one normally think of when talking about Exif data. This is
 * because Exif data is stored as an extension of the TIFF file
 * format.
